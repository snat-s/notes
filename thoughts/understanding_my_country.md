# Understanding my country from outside

I viewed news as entertainment. Most of the time I tended to get a bit
sad. News outlets inflate stories to have a few more eyeballs. The consequences
of not getting the entire picture is outrage. I wanted to be informed and
entretained. I did not leave. I decided to watch more of them and from other
countries.

My thesis was that people outside of my country can be more objective of what
happens inside. They are a third party. They should be able to tell fact from
fiction.

I gravitated to see the world from another perspective. Not my own or my
cultural view on topics. As a side product, the news that happened away from me
seemed more like a story. A narrative that is fun to watch and easy to keep
track of.

Watching this new "stories" changed my news consumption and I did not want any
of my depressing local stories. I wanted news from other places.

I realized that I could filter the news that I viewed and I could get only news
from other places.

This new media consumption hobby made me look informed because I was the only
one talking about the different topics that impacted the world. I knew the
natural and political disasters of a lot of countries but my own. I could have
an opinion about US politics. But for my country, I could only tell you the nane
of the current president.

I realized media cycles have other purposes. They inform about the news but
they talk a lot about their culture. I was learning about holidays, museums,
important cultural figures.

I got tired of only learning about countries from news sites. So I decided to
subscribe on Youtube to people from other countries and understand more of
their views. I was living in Mexico but passing four to ten hours a day on
other places. With the internet I could travel, and I wanted to explore.

I could go anywhere in the world. Even if I was not getting the entire picture.
You get there, you understand this people and how they express their view of
the country they leave in.

All of this came with a price. The cost of getting all of this new
entertainment and culture became apparent in the lack of my knowledge of my own
place.

This gave me a tiny cultural crisis. I felt like I did not belong anywhere. But
I realized that it was not important. Because I had become something new that
maybe people back in the day with books could experience it. I felt like a
cultural nobody.

I decided to quit. Viewing other countries and cultures this way is not
sustainable. I am no longer receiving news from other countries, and I stopped
watching the news on my own. I decided to go outside and experience the the
country I live in by going outside.
