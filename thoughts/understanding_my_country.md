# Understanding a country through it's media

When you view news as entertainment. Most of the time you tend to get a
bit more sad. Not that ignorance is bliss, but most of the time people
exaggerate stories to have a few more listeners. The consequences of
not getting the entire picture makes me feel a bit down. But when you
decide that maybe, getting news from another site is better and people
are a bit more objective.

Sometimes checking news from other countries is fun. And the better
thing is that they talk about the country you leave in a "more objective"
view because they are a third party.

With this, I gravitated to see the world from another perspective. Not
my own or my cultural view on topics. This was not that bad, the stories
that happened away from me seemed more like a story. A narrative that
is fun to watch and easy to keep track of.

My "needs" of information suddenly changed priorities and I did not want
any of my depressing local stories. I wanted the way of viewing others
cultures and changes. I realized that I could filter my life and just get
something to be informed about. Besides this, it made me look informed
because I was the only one talking about the different horrors of the
world. I knew the natural and political disasters of a lot of countries
but my own.

And before I could react to what I was doing two years had passed and I
knew everything about US politics and the best I could do for my country
was to tell you about the name of the president.

But the media cycles does not only get you with  the happenings of the
moment. It actually facilitates the one sided culture exchange. You learn
about multiple celebrations and understand the controversies behind some
of the achievements of the holidays.

Understanding all of a country just from a news site is pretty narrow. So
I decided to subscribe to people from that country and understand more
of their views. At that point of my life I was leaving in Mexico but
passing four to ten hours a day  on other places. The digital world gave
the possibilities to explore, and I wanted to explore other languages.

I got a travel pass to anywhere in the world. And even if the travel is
slower. You get there, you understand this people and how they move.

All of this came with a price. The cost of getting all of this new
entertainment and culture became apparent in the lack of my knowledge
of my own country.

This for a little gave me a different type of identity crisis. I
felt like I did not belong anywhere. But I realized that it was not
important. Because I had become something new that maybe people back in
the day with books could experience.
