# Finish things

## TLDR

Go and experiment. Create and finish projects. This way, you can experiment,
but get new knowledge for new areas.  

## Introduction

One of the problems that I get as a programmer is that I get really excited
about new technology. This is great if you want to research something and you
can get the basics in a week. This means I start a lot of stuff. I
like to experiment.

## In search of the shiny object

I think I'm still relatively young in my journey of discovery in the coding
world.  I have been programming (really programming) for roughly two years and
as of this moment I think I have ventured into a lot of different parts.

Knowing a bit of frontend, a bit of backend, some AI, some cyber security among
other things has given me a lot of joy. 

This has been really helpful because I can explore what I like and what I do
not.

But, here is the problem, with this much choice and knowing all of this
tid-bits of information you get a lot of ideas for a lot of projects but I tend
to not do them. 

This happens because I tend to have this happen to me: "How do they do that?".
"If I could implement it. Where would I start?" Almost all of this come from an
inherent curiosity, to build new things.

## The obvious problem

Ok, so now that I have experimented with a bunch of different programming
languages and fields of technology. I should know what my big project is going
to be, right?

I still think that this has not happened to me. Every time that I venture
into a part of engineering or computer science I find amazing communities with
people that are amazing and everyone is really welcoming.

This is a part that I still am in awe of. The amount of people that can collaborate 
on gigantic projects just because they have the same interest blows my head.

And this makes it a bit more difficult to decide which projects I should invest
my time in.

So feeling really confused and not sure what to do. It was a question that I
had in my head for roughly six months and I wrote a bit before about it.  But I
finally got some great advice about how to tackle this.

## The advice

So I was chatting with my ex cohost in my past internship. And I
voiced my thoughts on the overwhelming amount of amazing stuff that there
currently is everywhere and how it was too much. So here I voice what
he told me:

> Just finish stuff

It's okay to experiment, but what happens to me is that I never know if I love
something for real if I do not invest enough time. I was just doing the simple
things and then keep moving on in pursuit of a newer and shinier object.

So, just finishing the projects I start is a great idea. This advice has several
consequences. 

1. I have evidence of what I have done. 
1. I can understand the field better.
1. I can see if I like or not a subject.

The last one is the most important. It solves a lot of the issues that I was
having. Overall, it is great advice.
