As a programmer, I can see several titles that are interesting. You can be 
Frontend, Backend, Fullstack if you delve into web development. On the ML
world the title seems to be Data Scientist/Analyst and ML Engineer. For
testing there is QA Engineers. To have an infrastructure, there is DevOps
engineer. I feel that each one of this has its own place. To a certain degree,
I feel that there could be another type in this space. A master at making things
more efficient.

I can look at the software stack currently an think that there is a need for
it. A person in the organization that when the time for optimization seems good 
will go and clean the code and document the decisions of why certain actions 
are taken.

This role in my head seems to be a person that can see through the architecture
of an app and can make sound and cost efficient decisions.

This engineers would be the equivalent of industrial engineers for the rest of 
the production process.

Their role could be of advice in the beginning and if it is too late. They 
could be the help for refactoring the aplications if it is needed.

This elusive title is to a certain point a meta-title. This person would not
create a lot. But they could help a lot more. It could improve the current
state of documentation by explaining the reasons of decisions.

The need for this role would only appear truly in organizations that are big.
When it is time to poke at a legacy codebase. But, for example, it could
be used in the context of startups to help them with places that are making 
them loose money.

People can and have been optimizing prematurely. This can too be a problem.
The role could help in being the rails that sometimes people need. Not too
much and not too little, just the right amount.

This programmers would not be tied to any language or specific preference in
stack. They just have a preference for making things faster in a good way.

The need for this programmers can be seen as a bit superficial. No a lot of
companies care about the performance of their application. 
_If it works it is good enough._

I have an argument. If people want to reach the most people, they should
care about performance. With a poor connection to the internet, a lot of 
modern applications can not even fathom this and never in their wildest dreams
load completely. If people want to reach more people, optimizing for loads on
older devices is important.

This problem extends to applications that bundle everything imaginable just
in case.

This engineers could help close this gap of accesibility to less resource 
powered devices. This would have an increase in users.

This engineer is needed in the current enviroment because it is a need that 
is starting to appear. Not a single person needs that all applications work
as fast as quant trading firms. But it could help to separate the process of
creation from the process of perfection.
