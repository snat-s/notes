# Efficency Engineers

As a programmer, you can have several titles. You can be 
a frontend, backend, fullstack engineer if you are into web development. For
testing there is QA. To have an infrastructure, there is DevOps. But, I think 
that there is another type of engineer that could exist. A master at making 
things more efficient.

I look at the current software world and think that there is a need for
it. A person in the organization that will go and clean the code and 
document the decisions of why certain actions are taken.
An engineer that separates the act of creation from the act of perfection.

This title is to a certain point a meta-title. This person would not
create a lot. But they could help. They would support the main team of 
programmers.

This role in my head seems to be a person that can see through the architecture
of an app and prefers sound and cost efficient decisions.

This engineers would be the equivalent of industrial engineers for the rest of 
the production process. They could try to be a balancing force 
when adding features, to have a reasonable scope when planning for a new 
program. Their role could be of advice in the beginning. In bigger and bulkier
codebases they could be the help for simplification and optimization.
This programmers would not be tied to any language or specific preference in
stack. They just have a preference for making things faster. This engineers 
could shine in startups and big organizations. In big places they could 
poke at a legacy codebases and make them more efficient. And they could 
be used in startups to help them with places that are making them loose money.

People can and have been optimizing prematurely. This can be a problem.
The role could help in being the rails that sometimes people need. Not too
much and not too little, just the right amount of efficency.

The need for this programmers can be seen as a bit superficial. No a lot of
companies care about the performance of their application. 
**If it works it is good enough.**

I have an argument. If people want to reach the most people, they should
care about performance. With a poor connection to the internet, a lot of 
modern websites can not load completely. If people want to reach more
people, optimizing for loads on poor connections is important.

This engineers could help close this gap of accesibility to less resource 
powered devices and connections. As a result they could have a potential 
increase in users.

This engineer is needed in the current enviroment because it is a need to 
separte the process of creation from the process of perfection. Not a single
person needs that all applications work as fast as quant trading firms. But
 it could help to be able to run things in devices that are not the newest.
